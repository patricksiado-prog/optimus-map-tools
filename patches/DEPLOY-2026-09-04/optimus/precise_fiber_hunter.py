PRECISE FIBER HUNTER v0.4 (click-every-dot exact-address grabber)
=============================================================================
Drives the AT&T fiber map in a real Chromium window (Playwright), clicks each
dot, reads the EXACT address from the popup (confirmed live 2026-06-12:
"FIBER ELIGIBLE / Address: 8 GREENWAY PLZ UNIT 1111 / CREATE REFERRAL"),
records it, then pans to the next viewport. Snake pattern across a grid.

CHANGES v0.4 -> v0.5 (Mapbox fast path -- the OSM research conclusion):
 The dealer map is Mapbox GL JS on OpenStreetMap tiles. The dots are GeoJSON
 features INSIDE the page's map object, so instead of color-hunting pixels we
 hook mapboxgl.Map at page-init and ask the map directly:
   - queryRenderedFeatures() -> every dot's exact lng/lat + properties
   - if a feature carries the address in its properties -> record it with
     ZERO clicking;
   - else map.project(lnglat) -> exact CSS click pixel for that marker (no
     centroid guessing), then the v0.4 popup read.
 Pixel detection remains the automatic fallback when the hook finds nothing.
 (Nominatim reverse-geocoding was researched and REJECTED for this: the
 public API forbids systematic grid/bulk queries at 1 req/s, and OSM has no
 unit numbers -- the popup is the only unit-level source.)

CHANGES v0.3 -> v0.4 (the click-each-dot retool, from live screenshots
2026-06-12, Greenway Plaza / Edloe St session):
 1. CLICKS EVERY DOT, not just green. GREEN (lead) and GOLD (copper-upgrade)
    are both clicked and recorded with their legend status; GRAY (existing
    fiber customer) is detected but skipped and counted.
 2. RETRY CLICKS. The dots are ~6-10 px wide; one centroid click can miss the
    marker hit-zone and the address is silently lost. Now each dot gets up to
    5 attempts in a tiny spiral (center, then ±3 px offsets), verifying the
    popup actually opened after each attempt.
 3. POPUP POLLING. Fixed 1.1 s sleeps are gone -- the popup is polled every
    150 ms (up to 2.5 s) for the READY hints, so hits are fast and misses
    retry immediately.
 4. JSONL HANDOFF. Every capture is also appended to precise_addresses.jsonl
    {address, dot_status, popup_status, ban, area, ts} so business_score.py /
    ghl_loader.py can consume the run without Google Sheets in the middle.

CHANGES v0.2 -> v0.3 (accuracy fixes, ported from fiber_precise_pipeline):
 1. HiDPI FIX. v0.2 clicked at SCREENSHOT pixel coordinates. On HiDPI/scaled
    displays the screenshot is larger than the CSS viewport, so every click
    missed its dot (or hit a neighbor). Now:
      - device_scale_factor=1 on the browser context, AND
      - belt-and-suspenders sx/sy scaling from screenshot dims -> viewport
    so screenshot px always map onto click px.
 2. THRESHOLDS UNIFIED. v0.2's HSV window (OpenCV hue 70-95 = 140-190 real
    degrees) was teal/cyan -- it did NOT match the pipeline's proven RGB box
    and could find 0 dots on the same screen. Detection now imports the ONE
    canonical detector from optimus_dot_detect.py (numpy/PIL/scipy; the
    OpenCV dependency is gone).
 3. "Search this area" clicked after every pan -- without it the new view's
    dots never load (confirmed live, 77070, 2026-05-31), so v0.2 was often
    snake-scanning a map with stale or no dots.

KEPT FROM v0.2:
 - --zoom-in / --zoom-out flags (buttons, then keyboard, then wheel)
 - drain every dot in a viewport BEFORE panning; snake across the grid
 - RESUME: re-runs skip addresses already in the sheet
 - popup close fallback: x button -> empty map corner -> Escape

NOTE: for single-ZIP outage scans prefer fiber_precise_pipeline.py with
--api-substring -- it reads the map's backend JSON (exact address + lat/lng
+ BAN, no clicking at all). This hunter remains the wide-area grid tool and
the fallback when the API capture path is down.

COMPLIANCE (do not edit around this):
 Output feeds DOOR-KNOCK + DNC-SCRUBBED MANUAL CALL routes only. Map or
 skip-traced numbers are NEVER cold-texted (TCPA $500-$1,500 per text).

# Sheets error silently destroyed the rows. This hunter never had that buffer --
# but it had the same defect wearing different clothes: the dedupe key was
# marked `seen` while BUILDING the row, before the write was attempted. A failed
# batch was therefore lost AND permanently marked captured, so not even a

         -- the "cannot replay ... Read requests" errors. The worksheet is now
         looked up ONCE PER TAB and cached.

      2. It replayed every file, one append per file. Hundreds of tiny writes
         is the fastest way to hit the WRITE quota. Rows for the same tab are
         now merged and committed in full-size batches instead.

      3. Nothing was capped, so a failed replay left every file in place and
         the next launch had even more to choke on. It now drains a bounded
         amount per launch and says what is left, which converges instead of
         compounding.

    A file is deleted only once its rows are really in the sheet.

# ============================================================================
# PERIODIC BACKGROUND DEDUPE  (identical block in precise_fiber_hunter.py AND
# maps_scraper_standalone.py, so BOTH programs keep the tabs clean while they run)
#
# WHAT it cleans, per pass:
#   Precise Fiber ...... exact-duplicate ADDRESS rows (same address captured twice)
#   Maps Businesses .... same PHONE (else same NAME|ADDRESS) written twice
#   Fiber Green Biz .... same PHONE (else NAME|ADDRESS) -- collapses the ~8x
#   Upgrade Orange Biz . inflation where one business matched many unit/spelling
#                        address variants. Keeps the row that has a call
#                        disposition, else the first one. NO unique phone is ever
#                        dropped (verified: 21,662 -> 4,105 rows, phones lost = 0).
#
# SAFETY:
#   * Deletes only SPECIFIC duplicate row numbers, computed from a snapshot, and
#     applies them BOTTOM-UP -- rows appended live at the bottom are never in the
#     list, so a running hunt/scrape can keep writing during a pass with no loss.
#   * Writes a local CSV backup of a tab BEFORE it removes anything from it.
#   * A cross-machine advisory LOCK (a "_Dedupe Lock" cell) means the hunter and
#     the scraper never dedupe the same sheet at the same time (which could delete
#     shifted rows). If the lock can't be taken, the pass simply skips -- it never
#     risks a double-delete.
#   * Per-pass delete cap so the first big cleanup spreads over a few passes
#     instead of hammering the API; Precise Fiber (huge) is cleaned less often.

#   1. precise fiber cable outages -- a live buying window. The pipeline and

#      back, so a logged outage sat unseen until somebody opened the sheet.
#   2. suggested new build ZIPs    -- fiber_zone_scanner already scores every
#      ZIP it sweeps into 'Fiber Zones'. The ZIPs turning up the most NEW green
#      are where fiber was just lit.
# Read-only, and wrapped end to end: intel is never worth breaking a sweep for,
# so every failure degrades to one quiet line and the hunter carries on. Same
# rule the operator check follows.
