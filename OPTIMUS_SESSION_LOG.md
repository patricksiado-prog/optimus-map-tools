# Optimus Session Log

## 2026-05-23 22:03 CT — Claude
**SESSION GOAL:** Fix GitHub-write via Make so it reliably creates AND updates files, document it in the BRAIN, and start timestamp + session-goal stamping.

- Fixed Make scenario 5084486 (GitHub write): SHA read is now non-fatal (handleErrors), and the PUT includes `sha` only when the file already exists — so it creates new files and updates existing ones.
- This file being created here is the proof the create-path works.
- Capability map: GitHub write = Make scenario **5084486**. BRAIN append = Make scenario **5073448**. Both run via update-trigger → activate → run → deactivate.
