backend_classifier.py  —  Fiber Scout: read dots from the AT&T dealer-map
                          BACKEND JSON instead of sampling pixels.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The AT&T dealer map (youachieve.att.com) answers every "Search this area"
click with a JSON payload:

    { "success": true,
      "error":   {...},
      "content": [ {lead}, {lead}, ... ] }     # up to ~3000 leads

Each lead carries the ADDRESS + lat/lng + status directly, e.g.:

    {"zip":"77598","address":"558 TRESVANT DR","city":"WEBSTER","state":"TX",
     "latitude":"29.562304","longitude":"-95.144801",
     "subscriber_ban":"", "subscriber_ban_masked":"",
     "curr_ntwrk_bld_type_cd":"unavailable", "speed":"",
     "miles_from_claim":"0.10137", "missing_supl":0}

So the Scout does NOT need to count green/gold/grey pixels (the source of the
GREEN_MIN/GREEN_MAX calibration bug). It can read the truth from this JSON.

THE COLOR KEY (from the dealer-map legend, confirmed on the Third Ward view)
    GREEN  = Fiber eligible / NON-customer   -> THE PRIZE (lit, nobody signed up)
    GOLD   = Fiber eligible / COPPER customer -> upgrade target (on DSL now)
    GREY   = Fiber customer                    -> already sold, skip

THE SIGNAL THAT ACTUALLY WORKS  (corrected 2026-07-01 from a live 77027 capture)
    subscriber_ban  ""/empty  = NON-customer (GREEN lead)  |  present = customer
    curr_ntwrk_bld_type_cd    = the address's CURRENT AT&T network, NOT
                                availability. "unavailable" just means the
                                address has no AT&T service today -- which is
                                what a GREEN eligible non-customer looks like.
    >>> DO NOT treat "unavailable" as dead. A live capture over ZIP 77027 (a
        known green corridor) returned every green address as ban="" +
        curr_ntwrk_bld_type_cd="unavailable". Skipping "unavailable" threw away
        100% of the greens (the GREEN-0 bug). The map only plots eligible /
        customer dots anyway, so every record here is a real dot.

WHAT WE DON'T KNOW YET (a CUSTOMER-area capture answers it)
    Among CUSTOMERS (ban present), which curr_ntwrk_bld_type_cd values mean an
    existing FIBER subscriber (GREY) vs a COPPER customer (GOLD). Run inspect()
    over an area with customers, then drop those codes into
    FIBER_BUILD_CODES / COPPER_BUILD_CODES below. Greens don't need this.
