OPTIMUS DOT DETECT v1.0 -- the ONE place dot-color thresholds + dot detection live.
=============================================================================
Both map scanners import from here so the thresholds can never drift apart
again:
  - fiber_precise_pipeline.py  (signal -> ZIP -> capture/click -> exact address)
  - precise_fiber_hunter.py    (grid snake scan, click every dot)

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (threshold unification):
  precise_fiber_hunter v0.2 detected dots in HSV with OpenCV hue 70-95.
  OpenCV hue is 0-179 (degrees/2), so 70-95 is 140-190 REAL degrees -- that is
  teal/cyan, NOT the vivid green of AT&T's dots.
  fiber_precise_pipeline used an RGB box (30,130,30)-(100,210,80) whose hue is
  roughly 100-140 real degrees (OpenCV 50-70). The two windows barely touch:
  on a screen where the RGB box is right, the HSV window can return 0 dots.
  The pipeline's comment "same thresholds as fiber_hunter -- DO NOT retune"
  was wrong about them being equivalent.

  CANONICAL = the RGB box below. It was confirmed against a live 77070
  session (2026-05-31 screenshots). Tune HERE only, never in the scanners.

Dependencies: numpy, pillow, scipy (no OpenCV needed).

# customers) climbs. So the grey SHARE is the freshness signal:

#     high grey share                    -> MATURE (worked/penetrated, skip)
